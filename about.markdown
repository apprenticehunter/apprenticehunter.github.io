As an adult-onset hunter, fisher, and woodsman, I hope that I can encourage others to actively participate in the wilderness.
Learning to hunt has taken me out of the city to learn hands-on about local ecology and conservation; as an added bonus I sometimes bring home dinner.

**I'm by no means an expert, and that's part of the point.**

No matter your experience, background, or location, it's never too late to get outside and learn.

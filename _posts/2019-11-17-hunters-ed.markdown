I made the decision to try out hunting while spending Christmas in Ontario. A few years prior I moved to a major city, and the itch to get outdoors had become undeniable.

Learning to hunt without a mentor or experience can be intimidating. Don't let that discourage you! Just know that it will take some patience and regular effort.
The best advice I can give to start is to set your expectations - between learning about your quarry, finding a place to hunt, and figuring out how to do it legally, you'll be learning a lot.

My personal experience was in Illinois, but much of what I learned should apply across the continental United States.
Over the next few posts, I'll cover everything I needed to get started. There are plenty of ways to approach this, but hopefully some or all of what I found can be useful.

Starting out in December ended up being good timing. With the exception of turkeys, most hunting seasons begin in the fall (in many places there's a second fall turkey season as well).
This left plenty of time to do some homework at a slow and steady pace. Unless you were born before the cutoff, the first step is generally a state-approved [hunter's education course](https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/safety/Pages/HunterSafety.aspx).
The nice part is that many states will respect one another's approved classes, so you'll only need to do this once. Check your state DNR website to sign up.

While there is an option to pay a few dollars for an online course, I highly recommend the free in-person class.
For me, this lasted two days and was held in a local rec center classroom. I have to give credit to the instructors: both were seasoned hunters who volunteered to share hard-won experience with others.
It's worth noting that the goal of these classes isn't to teach you _how_ to hunt, but rather to explain how to do it safely. Highlights included:

* Firearms
* Tree stands
* Game-specific safety
* Proper attire

There was also a visit from a CPO, or game warden, to cover rules and regulations for different game. CPO's have legal powers beyond regular police, so it pays to know the laws around what you're doing.
For those unfamiliar with firearms, the instructors brought a shotgun and rifle with the firing pins removed so people could practice handling and loading them.

At the end of the two days, you get a hunter's safety card with an ID number. **Put this somewhere safe**. You'll need it when you later apply for your license.

At this point you should be well on your way! While the focus of the course is safety, you'll likely leave hunter's ed with a fair bit of information beyond that.
That's it for this time - next up we'll discuss getting ready for your season.
